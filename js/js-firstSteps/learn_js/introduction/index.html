		<h1>A MAD MAN'S ADVICE</h1>
		<p>
		They say a good day is seen in the morning. In this context, I could call my February,
		March and April a morning. It was dark though. Could hear birds chirping in the trees,
		crickets quiet and the stars already fading away as if to welcome a new day. Could a morning be postponed?
		Could it be that I woke up late for my day? All in all, the day downed though in a confused state.
		I feel like I'm now in the noon time yet my clock reads evening. Will I manage the tasks required before dusk?
		Is it possible or should I just call my self a lazy bustard? Naaaaaah! Never give up so quickly sir; <q cite="The Holy Bible"><em>The end of a matter is better than the <b>beninging!</b></em></q>.
		Aah! I feel revived and encouraged by this. It also says,
		<q cite="The Holy Bible">
			The one who entered to labor in the morning and the one who entered in the evening all received the same pay.</q>
		
		<p><b>S.cool</b> wonders:</p>
		<blockquote>
			Will I really receive a similar pay as one who started their morning at the set clock hour? Again, the Lord is sovereign and is not affected by time. In fact, He himself created time. Space is not a factor for him to accomplish all He want. Amazing!
			<p>Or should I just let it pass!</p>
		</blockquote>
